# Introduction to the project
introduction: |-
  This `terraform-aws-utils` project provides some simple utilities to use when working in AWS. At the moment, it is
  limited to providing compact alternative codes for Regions, Availability Zones, and Local Zones that are
  guaranteed to use only digits and lower case letters: no hyphens. Conversions to and from official codes
  and alternative codes are handled via lookup maps.

  The `short` abbreviations are variable length (generally 4-6 characters, but length limits not guaranteed)
  and strictly algorithmically derived so that people can more easily interpret them.
  The `fixed` abbreviations are always exactly 3 characters for regions and 4 characters
  for availability zones and local zones, but have some exceptional cases (China, Africa, Asia-Pacific South, US GovCloud)
  that have non-obvious abbreviations.

  We currently support Local Zones but not Wavelength Zones. If we support Wavelength Zones in the future,
  it is likely that the fixed-length abbreviations for them will be non-intuitive.

  The intention is that existing mappings will never change, and if new regions or zones are created that
  conflict with existing ones, they will be given non-standard mappings so as not to conflict.

# How to use this module. Should be an easy example to copy and paste.
usage: |-
  Here's how to invoke this example module in your projects

  ```hcl
  locals {
    shorten_regions   = true
    naming_convention = local.shorten_regions ? "to_short" : "identity"
    az_map            = module.example.region_az_alt_code_maps[local.naming_convention]
  }

  module "utils_example_complete" {
    source  = "cloudposse/utils/aws"
    # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
    # version     = "x.x.x"
  }

  module "label" {
    source = "cloudposse/label/null"
    # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
    # version     = "x.x.x"

    attributes = [local.az_map["us-east-2"]]

    context = module.this.context
  }
  ```
