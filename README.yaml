# Introduction to the project
introduction: |-
  This `terraform-aws-utils` module provides some simple utilities to use when working in AWS.
  More complex utilities are available through Cloud Posse's `utils` Terraform provider
  [terraform-provider-utils](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-provider-utils).

  ### Compact Alternative Codes (Abbreviations)
  This module's primary function is to provide compact alternative codes for Regions, Availability Zones,
  and Local Zones, codes which are guaranteed to use only digits and lower case letters: no hyphens.
  Conversions to and from official codes and alternative codes are handled via lookup maps.

  - The `short` abbreviations are variable length (generally 4-6 characters, but length limits not guaranteed)
  and strictly algorithmically derived so that people can more easily interpret them. The `short` region
  code abbreviations typically match the prefix of the Availability Zone IDs in that region, but this is
  not guaranteed.
  - The `fixed` abbreviations are always exactly 3 characters for regions and 4 characters
  for availability zones and local zones, but have some exceptional cases (China, Africa, Asia-Pacific South, US GovCloud)
  that have non-obvious abbreviations.
  - The `identity` "abbreviations" are not abbreviations but are instead the official codes (output equals input,
  which is why it is called "identity"). This map is provided to simplify algorithmic choice of region code
  abbreviation when you want to include a "no abbreviation" option.

  We currently support Local Zones but not Wavelength Zones. If we support Wavelength Zones in the future,
  it is likely that the fixed-length abbreviations for them will be non-intuitive.

  The intention is that existing mappings will never change, and if new regions or zones are created that
  conflict with existing ones, they will be given non-standard mappings so as not to conflict.

  ### ELB Logging Account IDs

  This module provides Elastic Load Balancing Account IDs per region to be used in
  configuring [S3 Bucket Permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-access-logs.html#access-logging-bucket-permissions)
  to allow access logs to be stored in S3.

  ### Enabled and Disabled Regions

  For convenience, this module provides lists of enabled and disabled regions in the current account. Note that
  since these lists are dynamic, they cannot be used in Terraform `count` or `for_each` resource expressions.

# How to use this module. Should be an easy example to copy and paste.
usage: |-
  Here's how to invoke this example module in your projects

  ```hcl
  locals {
    shorten_regions   = true
    naming_convention = local.shorten_regions ? "to_short" : "identity"
    az_map            = module.example.region_az_alt_code_maps[local.naming_convention]
  }

  module "utils_example_complete" {
    source  = "cloudposse/utils/aws"
    # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
    # version     = "x.x.x"
  }

  module "label" {
    source = "cloudposse/label/null"
    # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
    # version     = "x.x.x"

    attributes = [local.az_map["us-east-2"]]

    context = module.this.context
  }
  ```
